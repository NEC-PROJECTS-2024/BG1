### INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is main reason for mortality in woman. Prediction of breast cancer is a challenging task in medical data analysis. Each year number of deaths is increasing extremely because of breast cancer. It is the most frequent type of all cancers and the major cause of death in women worldwide. Doctors and pathologists require some automated tools to take decision and to differentiate between malignant and benign tumour. A machine learning (ML) algorithm helps lot to take decisions and to perform diagnosis from the data collected by medical field. Various researches show that ML techniques are helpful for decision making in breast cancer prediction. Machine learning techniques can bring a large contribute on the process of prediction and early diagnosis of breast cancer. In this project, our main objective is to predict and diagnosis breast cancer, using machine-learning algorithms, and find out the most effective with respect to confusion matrix, accuracy and precision.
